      <li>CSS stands for Casecading Style Sheet.</li>
      <br />
      <li>
        CSS describe how HTML elements are to be displayed on the screen, paper,
        or in other media

    <h3>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h3>

    <ul class="ul1">
      <li>Inline - by using the style attribute insite HTML elements.</li>
      <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section.</li>
      <li>
        External - by using a link element to link to an extrenal CSS file.
      </li>
      <li>
        The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS
        file. However, <span class="span"><strong> in this for you to try it yourself.</strong></span>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      When comparing CSS class vs ID, the differenec is that CSS class applies a
      style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one
      unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to
      link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.
    </p>

    <p>
      In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of
      element on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set
      of style can be applied to the element.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is a wide range of selectors availabe: Two most commonly used are
      class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be
      applied.
